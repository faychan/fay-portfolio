      "description": "üëã I'm Farah Noriffat who was born in London in 2001. I'm interested in IT and computers since I was in kindergarten where I explore computers and programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãeveryday. Unfortunately, in the small town I grew up in, Pasuruan, not many could provide satisfactory knowledge about IT, so after junior high school I started to flap my wings outside my comfort zone to study at SMK TELKOM Malang, the best private school‚≠ê in Indonesia. After entering I began to understand how computers work and the most important thing is to understand the contents of the programmer's brain to be one of them. After graduating I was introduced to the concepts of Frontend and Backend. There I chose to become a Frontend and was very satisfied with the position I chose. Now with the breadth of the world and the knowledge that I still haven't explored. I can't wait to explore the world to learn and learnüíú",
